# TalentGate

**TalentGate** is a production-grade hiring platform where job seekers maintain a single evolving profile and employers review candidates efficiently using role-based dashboards and swipe-style workflows.

The platform is designed to reduce application friction, speed up hiring decisions, and introduce AI-assisted matching — while keeping humans in control.
